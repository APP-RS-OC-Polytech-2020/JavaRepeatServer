Otherwise, if you simply need to run it, grab a jar from the [Release Page] then run it using a simple `java -jar ./nameOfJar.jar` and it should work right out. There's not much more config you need, or that is possible at the moment. You might want to run `-help` to know the launch options, although there arn't many.
